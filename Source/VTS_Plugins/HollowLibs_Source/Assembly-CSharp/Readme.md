# Hollowlib - Assembly-CSharp
This is a hollow Assembly-CSharp library that can be used in Unity project when writting components that inherit some classes compiled inside VTube Studio's Assembly-CSharp library.

Do not copy the built library to VTS as it will make VTS impossible to use! Just prototype your plugin components using UnityVTSPlugin project, build it and copy required Asset Bundles and your own custom libraries to VTS.
